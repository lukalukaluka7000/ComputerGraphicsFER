# ComputerGraphicsFER
The main repository of laboratory exercises in Computer Graphics at FER.

CGLA (Computer Graphics Laboratory Assignment)

First assignment deals with creating b-spline curve which is used as a path for simple object.
Second assignment deals with snow flakes as particles in whole system where particles are 2D quad primitives.

Third assignment is improvised project (pdf documentation in main directory).
The project deals with the merging of several concepts in computer graphics that we discussed during the course at FER.

It may be useful for those who would like to get started with graphics and want to grasp basic concepts that are necessary but do not have excessive programming experience.

GL, GLU and GLUT libraries must be installed within the python programming language to run the project. Typing "python main_proba.py" should work immediately.

The top priority for further refinement of the project would be to move the project to C++ programming language.
